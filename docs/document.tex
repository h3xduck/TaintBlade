\section{Introduction}
TODO - This section introduces the problem we are dealing with and motivates the creation of this tool

\section{Background}

TODO - This section goes over the state of the art on analyzing malware binaries, past work on protocol reverse 
engineering and available tools. 

\section{Design}
TODO - This section covers the general structure of the tool and the different modules and functionalities implemented.

\section{Implementation}
TODO - This section goes into detail on the algorithms implemented in the tool, including an overview of how the tainting
engine works and how the heuristics engine and the protocol reversing engine on top work.

\section{Evaluation}
TODO - This section covers multiple test cases, including custom programs that we will include in our repository that showcase
some easy-to-understand cases we want to show that work, and some others that are real malware found in the wild.

\section{Related work}
TODO decide whether to include this or not - It might fit better in the background

\section{Conclusion}
TODO - This section offers an overview of the developed tool and the results obtained over the problem we were trying to solve.
