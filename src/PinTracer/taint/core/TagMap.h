/*
	TagMaps describe shadow memory, incorporating taint data.

	16 taint colors are supported, taint is applied at byte level.

	The architecture is based on that of libdft, incorporating a STAB (Segment Translation Table)
	which contains one entry for each memory page, allowing for allocating shadow memory on demand
	for each new virtual memory allocated by the program.
